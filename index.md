        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Mariana, a sophmore at UC Berkeley and intended Computer Science major. At the moment, my academic interests include artificial intelligence research, cs theory, and applied mathematics. Outside of academics, I spend my free time practicing classical pieces on my piano, reading fiction, or working on side projects.

          <h3>Covid-19 US-Mexican Border Crossing Risk Assessor</h3>

            <p>
              A couple of other undergraduate students and I formed a team and enrolled in the UCSD Covid-19 Data Challenge. By collecting publicly available data on bus routes along the U.S. and Mexican border, my team and I were able to map out recommendations of safer routes that were less crowded and reported the least number of Covid-19 cases. Using our web development skills, we embedded interactive visualizations into our site to enhance the user experience. At the close of the competition, we won an honorary mention and a monetary award.

             <p>
              Last semester, I was a mentee of the Directed Reading Program at UC Berkeley. Under the guidance of my graduate student mentor, I explored clustering methods that made use of finite difference methods to identify groups formed at numerous time steps in the heat equation.

              Currently, I am participating at the Medix REU program and developing a deep learning model to classify OCT images of age-related macular degeneration. Much of my summer has been spent learning machine learning concepts, familiarizing myself with software tools such as tensorflow, reading research papers, and refining my project's methodology.
